🚥 **Welcome to the backend of a Formula 1 season**🚥

This project implements a robust backend for solutions that digitize Formula 1 regulations and logistics using the power of ORACLE SQL. This stands out through strict data integrity, 
using complex constraints to validate team budgets, drivers' contracts, and the technical details of the cars.This includes automatic mechanisms (ON DELETE CASCADE) and pre-compiled 
views to generate instant standings and detailed statistics for the season.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `/database` - The engine (SQL Scripts).
* `/docs` - The strategy book (ER Diagrams & Documentation).
* `/apex` - Web Interface.
  
## 🏆 Future Upgrades
While the current version is fully localized in **Romanian** 🇷🇴, the next steps focus on:
* [ ] Full English version.
* [ ] A Java-based GUI for easier management.

***Box, box!! We are switching to Java soon!***
